In this project, I scraped data from DAWN News, a reliable Pakistani news
source, and performed sentiment analysis to calculate the levels of negativity, neutrality,
positivity, and compound scores in the headlines. I then merged the sentiment data with HBL
stock data into one dataset, which was used for training an LSTM model to predict the target
variable, such as future stock prices. The dataset was designed to provide historical sequences
of feature values, allowing the LSTM model to identify patterns over time. Finally, I
produced visualizations, including time series graphs of stock prices and the distribution of
stock attributes.
